CAVEAT (copied from link above): **The ICMJE cannot verify the completeness or accuracy of this list.** 

* There may be some journals that follow the ICMJE recommendations, but have never requested listing.

* There may be some listed journals that do not follow all of the many recommendations and policies in the document.

One example are all PLOS Journals: none are listed except PLOS Medicine, which is an ICMJE member journal. However, many other PLOS journals explicitly point to the ICMJE recommendations.
